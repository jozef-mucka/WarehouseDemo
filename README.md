# WarehouseDemo
Demo SpringBoot Java web app made after watching a Youtube video course and remembering what I used at work some time ago.
If you need to test me further for job interview purpouses, write me a message what else I should implement.
Technologies used: Spring Boot + Thymeleaf + jQuery.
